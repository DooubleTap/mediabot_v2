Installation of Mediabotv2 Last revised: Feb 04, 2018

INSTALLING Mediabotv2

You need to install MySQL or MariaDB first (refer to documentation depending on your linux distribution).

Create a non-privileged user for the bot (ex : mediabot).

You will then need to add sudo rights for it for the configuration stage (you can remove this right after).

Run ./configure and follow all steps

RUNNING Mediabotv2

After configuration you should have a configuration file generated by configure (ex : mediabot.conf)

You can launch the bot with commands :

./mediabot.pl --conf=mediabot.conf

or in daemon mode

./mediabot.pl --conf=mediabot.conf --daemon

read COMMANDS files to know how to register it at first use and refer to bot log file to know what is going on.
